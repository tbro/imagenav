# imagenav
A very simple image navigator that keeps a control channel open on
stdin. Usefull for exploring images on a romote box over ssh.

Only tested on linux as of today.

## usage

Accepts a directory containing images as input. It *should* filter out
non-image files. No recursion is done into sub-directories.

	imagenav ~/dir/photos/

### commands

Currently supported commands are

	* `->` (arrow right) next image
    * `<-` (arrow left) previous image
	* `f`  fullscreen
	* `r`  rotate
	* `p`  pageant mode (automatically scroll through the images)
    * `q`  quit

## dependencies

You need sdl libraries on your OS. Milage may vary depending on sytem, but on debian-like apt can obtain them for you: 

	sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-2.0-0

## display

You may need to export your display. `:1` may or may not be correct
depending on your system.

	export DISPLAY=:1
